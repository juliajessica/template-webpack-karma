## <span style="color:#74875d;">Description</span>

_This webpage application is designed to take the a poem from the user and return whether in fact the poem is a haiku. To understand what a kaiku is please feel free to reference this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku">link</a>._

_This project uses Webpack to bundle and minify the code. The test runner is Karma and the syntax flavor is Jasmine. Babel is used to transpile ES6. All dependencies required are included in this project._

## <span style="color:#74875d;">Setup/Installation Requirements</span>

* Clone repository on your local computer.
* If you already have Node, Homebrew, and Karma installed, then skip to "Install Dependencies."

  #### Node: Windows / Linux Installation Instructions
  To install Node on other systems, go to the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node website</a>, download and install the appropriate installer for your operating system.
  

  #### Node: OSX Installation Instructions
  ```On OS X systems, install Node.js through Homebrew with the following command in your home directory:
    $ brew install node
  ```
  ```Confirm that node and npm (node package manager, installed automatically with Node) are in place by checking the versions (Node should be 4.0.x or higher, npm should be 3.6.x or higher):
  ```
    $ node -v
    $ npm -v
  ````
  #### Homebrew Installation
  ```If you do not have Homebrew installed yet, you may install it by copying and pasting this command:
     $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
  ```Next, ensure Homebrew packages are run before the system versions of the same (which may be dated or not what we want) by executing the following:
    $ echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
  ```
  #### Karma Installation
  ```If you do not have Karma installed globally, then run the following:
     $ npm install -g karma-cli
   ```
  #### Install dependencies
  ```Enter the following code in the command line to install all dependencies:
    $ npm install
  ```

  #### Working with the project in Node:
  ```To build and bundle the project in webpack run the following:
    $ npm run build
  ```To run the local test server:
    $ npm run start
  ```To run test in Karma:
    $ npm test
  ```
