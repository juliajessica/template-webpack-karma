* Clone repository on your local computer.
* If you already have Node, Homebrew, and Karma installed, then skip to **Install Dependencies**.

  #### Node: Windows / Linux Installation Instructions
  To install `Node` on other systems, go to the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node website</a>, download and install the appropriate installer for your operating system.

  #### Node: OSX Installation Instructions
  On OS X systems, install `Node.js` through Homebrew with the following command in your home directory:
    ```sh
    $ brew install node
    ```
  Confirm that Node version is 4.0.x or higher and npm should be 3.6.x or higher:
  ```sh
    $ node -v
    $ npm -v
  ```

  #### Homebrew Installation
  If you do not have `Homebrew` installed yet, you may install it by copying and pasting this command:
  ```sh
    $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
  ```
  Next, ensure Homebrew packages are run before the system versions of the same (which may be dated or not what we want) by executing the following:
  ```sh
    $ echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
  ```

  #### Install dependencies
  Enter the following code in the command line to install all dependencies:
  ```sh
    $ npm install
  ```

  To run the local server:
  ```sh
    $ npm run start
  ```
