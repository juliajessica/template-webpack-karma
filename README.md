* Clone repository on your local computer.
* If you already have Node, Homebrew, and Karma installed, then skip to **Install Dependencies**.

  #### Node: Windows / Linux Installation Instructions
  To install `Node` on other systems, go to the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node website</a>, download and install the appropriate installer for your operating system.
  
  #### Node: OSX Installation Instructions
  On OS X systems, install `Node.js` through Homebrew with the following command in your home directory:
    ```sh
    $ brew install node
    ```
  Confirm that node and npm (node package manager, installed automatically with Node) are in place by checking the versions (Node should be 4.0.x or higher, npm should be 3.6.x or higher):
  ```sh
    $ node -v
    $ npm -v
  ````
  #### Homebrew Installation
  If you do not have `Homebrew` installed yet, you may install it by copying and pasting this command:
  ```sh
    $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
  ```
  Next, ensure Homebrew packages are run before the system versions of the same (which may be dated or not what we want) by executing the following:
  ```sh
    $ echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
  ```
  #### Karma Installation
  If you do not have `Karma` installed globally, then run the following:
  ```sh   
     $ npm install -g karma-cli
   ```
  #### Install dependencies
  ```Enter the following code in the command line to install all dependencies:
    $ npm install
  ```

  #### Working with the project in Node:
  To build and bundle the project in webpack run the following:
  ```sh
    $ npm run build
  ```
  To run the local test server:
  ```sh
    $ npm run start
  ```
  To run test in `Karma`:
  ```sh
    $ npm test
  ```
